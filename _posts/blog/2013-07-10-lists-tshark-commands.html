<p>Here are some of the more useful commands I am using to sort through tons of pcaps I gathered:<br />
This one recursively looks for kismet pcap files and runs tshark against them. This example is looking for a count of the SSID and the privacy bit for each of the beacon frames.</p>
<p>find . -iname '*pcapdump' -exec sh -c 'tshark -r "{}" -T fields -e wlan_mgt.ssid -e wlan_mgt.fixed.capabilities.privacy -R "wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08"' ;| sort | uniq -c</p>
