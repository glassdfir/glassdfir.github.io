title: Use Python to Encrypt Memory Files

<p>I was looking for a way to quickly encrypt large files in python.

After some digging, I ran across<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16761458/how-to-aes-encrypt-decrypt-files-using-python-pycrypto-in-an-openssl-compatible" target="_blank"> this post on stackoverflow.com.</a>Â The basic idea here is to use standard python libraries to take a plaintext file and make an AES encrypted copy in a manner that is compatible with OpenSSL tools.<br />
The code provided in the post work like a charm when collecting memory, disk space is a big issue. Most systems these days are running at least 8GB. Making two full size copies of a memory dump on a host machine is not practical even under ideal conditions. Even if I compress first, we still need enough free space to cover of the original plus the compressed copy. Sometimes that is not available.<br />
To help with this issue, I adapted the script to encrypt the file as it reads it.<br />
{% highlight python %}
from hashlib import md5
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto import Random
def derive_key_and_iv(password, salt, key_length, iv_length):
    d = d_i = ''
    while len(d) < key_length + iv_length:
        d_i = md5(d_i + password + salt).digest()
        d += d_i
    return d[:key_length], d[key_length:key_length+iv_length]
def encrypt(in_file, out_file, password, key_length=32):
    bs = AES.block_size
    salt = Random.new().read(bs - len('Salted__'))
    key, iv = derive_key_and_iv(password, salt, key_length, bs)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    out_file.write('Salted__' + salt)
    finished = False
    while not finished:
        chunk = in_file.read(1024 * bs)
        if len(chunk) == 0 or len(chunk) % bs != 0:
            padding_length = (bs - len(chunk) % bs) or bs
            chunk += padding_length * chr(padding_length)
            finished = True
        out_file.write(cipher.encrypt(chunk))
def decrypt(in_file, out_file, password, key_length=32):
    bs = AES.block_size
    salt = in_file.read(bs)[len('Salted__'):]
    key, iv = derive_key_and_iv(password, salt, key_length, bs)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    next_chunk = ''
    finished = False
    while not finished:
        chunk, next_chunk = next_chunk, cipher.decrypt(in_file.read(1024 * bs))
        if len(next_chunk) == 0:
            padding_length = ord(chunk[-1])
            chunk = chunk[:-padding_length]
            finished = True
        out_file.write(chunk)
zipfilename = "RapidFire_Collection.zip"
with open(zipfilename, 'rb+') as in_file, open(zipfilename, 'rb+') as out_file:
    encrypt(in_file, out_file, password)
{% endhighlight %}
Here is the important tweak that I made:<br />
{% highlight python %}
#This is the important snippet from Thijs van Dien's code on stackoverflow:
with open(in_filename, 'rb') as in_file, open(out_filename, 'wb') as out_file:
    encrypt(in_file, out_file, password)
#Opens the in_filename with read binary permissions as "in_file" and
#Opens the out_filename with write binary permissions as outfile
#With a slight adjustment we can overwrite the original file as we go
with open(in_filename, 'rb+') as in_file, open(in_filename, 'rb+') as out_file:
    encrypt(in_file, out_file, password)
#Opens two copies of the in_filename BOTH with read/write binary permissions
#This will allow use to read a chunk of the file, encrypt, and write to the top of the file, repeat
{% endhighlight %}
So we are reading chunk of the file, encrypting it, then overwriting the chunk with encrypted data until we get to the end of the file.<br />
Does this really work you ask? Of course it does.<br />

Don't know why this feels like a magic trick but TA DA!<br />
This doesn't fix all of my issues with moving huge files around but this does encrypt it locally before it is sent over the network without needing double the space.<br />
Big thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1163893/thijs-van-dien" target="_blank">Thjis van Dien</a> for putting this solution out there.</p>
