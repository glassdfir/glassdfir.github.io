<p>So recently there was a request on a DFIR mailing list about recovering $MFT FILE records.<br />
That got me thinking about the creation of the $MFT so I added a new virtual drive to a VM and formatted it.<br />


Here are the entries I found on a brand new $MFT:<br />
<strong>"0","File","/$MFT"</strong><br />
The master file table (MFT) stores the information required to retrieve files from an NTFS partition.<br />

<strong>"1","File","/$MFTMirr"</strong><br />
This is a system file that duplicates at least the first four FILE records of the MFT for recovery purposes.<br />

<strong>"2","File","/$LogFile"</strong><br />
The NTFS log file is a circular log of all file operations, kept on disk so that unsuccessful operations can be rolled back safely.<br />

<strong>"3","File","/$Volume"</strong><br />
Contains information about the volume, such as the volume label and the volume version.<br />

<strong>"4","File","/$AttrDef"</strong><br />
Lists attribute names, numbers, and descriptions.<br />

<strong>"5","Folder","/."</strong><br />
Root folder.<br />
<strong>"6","File","/$Bitmap"</strong><br />
Keeps track of all of the used and unused clusters on an NTFS volume.<br />

"7","File","/$Boot"<br />
"Boot Sector" Bootable partition that stores information about the layout of the volume and the file system structures, as well as the boot code that loads Ntdlr.<br />

"8","File","/$BadClus"<br />
NTFS puts the address of the cluster containing the bad sector in the bad cluster file, $BadClus, in the MFT so that the bad sector is not reused.<br />

"8","File","/$BadClus:$Bad"<br />
Alternate Data Stream of $BadClus.<br />
"9","File + Unknown2","/$Secure"<br />
The Security Descriptor Stream ($SDS) contains a list of all the Security Descriptors on the volume.<br />

"9","File + Unknown2","/$Secure:$SDS"<br />
"10","File","/$UpCase"<br />
This is a 128KB file full of capital letters. For each character in the Unicode alphabet, there is an entry in this file. It is used to compare and sort filenames.<br />

"10","File","/$UpCase:$Info"<br />
