<p>I heard a famous quote from Lincoln a while ago and it basically summaries the point of this blog.</p>
<p><a href="http://quotevadis.com/post/22894529794/abraham-lincoln-give-me-six-hours-to-chop-down-a-tree">Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.</a></p>
<p>I hope to use this a means to document my various attempts to master IT security. This is going to be my personal resource to reference for things I find noteworthy on the net or things I have tried that are worth documenting or doing again. The first few posts I plan on doing are about my lab setup at home. It is shaping up to be pretty spiffy. From there I plan on posting something at least once a week or so to justify the blog's existence and keep me motivated. We'll see where this goes.</p>
<p>For those of you that don't know why I spelled ax wrong, <a title="feel free to bone up on TCP/IP." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure" target="_blank">feel free to bone up on TCP/IP.</a></p>
