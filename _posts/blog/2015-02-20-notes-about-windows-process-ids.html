<p>Here are somethings I discovered about Windows Process IDs that I did not previously know...</p>

ProcessIDs are stored as DWORDs.<br />
A DWORD is a 32-bit unsigned integer (range: 0 through 4294967295 decimal).<br />
ProcessIDs are divisible by 4 so the highest possible pid is 4,294,967,292.<br />
Since they are divisible by 4, there are only 1,073,741,823 possible PIDs.<br />
I wrote a script to keep launching and closing "calc.exe" until it gave me the PID I wanted.<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/glassdfir/28f4311cceaf1fa7f069.js"></script><br />
On average, it took around 103 tries to get the pid I wanted.<br />
I knew PIDs get reused all the time but its weird that it happens so often.<br />
The whole problem with the sysmonmap from <a href="https://jon.glass/looks-at-the-win10-boot-process/" target="_blank">here</a><br />
is that there was a PID reused in under a second. That has got to cause other problems than just logging.</p>
<p>I am not investing any actual research time on this but I am documenting the trivia nonetheless.</p>
