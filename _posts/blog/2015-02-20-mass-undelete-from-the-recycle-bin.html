<p>This is more "e-discovery" than forensics but I recently had a case where I needed to 1,300 files that were in a user's Recycle Bin.
</p>
It was not overly important to the user's management when they were originally created or when it was deleted. They just wanted to review the documents. So I took an hour and hammered out this beast.<br />

#Purpose: 	Copy all of the contents of the Recycle Bin to a destination folder
#		perserving the dir structure and filename.
#		Not meant as a forensically sound aquistion tool. Just a means to an end.
#This hack job of a python script does:
#1. Looks for $I files
#2. Checks to see if the corresponding $R file exists
#3. Parses $I files to get the original filename and path
#4. Copies the $R file to the output folder recreating the original dir structure
# Example:
# c:\test\subdir\uselessfile.txt gets deleted.
# This script will copy the file out of the Recycle Bin to c:\Temp\Root\Test\subdir\uselessfile.txt.
# If one already exists there, it will keep trying make a unique name ex: uselessfile12345.txt
